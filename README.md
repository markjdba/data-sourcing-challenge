# data-sourcing-challenge

This is the readme.md for data-sourcing-challenge (Module 6). To run this Jupyter notebook open this file in VS Code:
data_sourcing-challlenge.ipynb

To run this Jupyter notebook, the .env file of the user needs to contain a NASA API key, which can be obtained here:
https://api.nasa.gov/

I ran into issues with the lamba function in both Part 1 and Part 2 and could not proceed past that point in either section.
